INTRO_LUKE,,"“But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies; do good to
those who hate you; bless those who curse you; pray for those who
mistreat you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other
also, and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold
even your shirt. Give to everyone who asks of you, and if anyone
takes away what is yours, do not ask for it back again. Do to
others as you would have them do to you.

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For
even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who
do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do
the same. If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive
payment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners,
to receive as much again. Instead, love your enemies, do good, and
lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and
you will be children of the Most High, for he himself is kind to
the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is
merciful.

-The author of the Gospel According to Luke, NRSVUE”"
